 * @date   June 1, 2021
 *
 * Implement several functions using both iteration and recursion.
 * For more practice with using basic C/C++ arrays, we will
 * write functions taking arrays as input to be manipulated.
 *
 * This file contains the actual implementation of the functions
 * and code you are required to complete for Assignment Recursion.
 * Make sure you modify the file header information to be correct
 * for the code you are creating.

// In this assignment you will not be given the function documentation
// comments ahead of time.  But you are required to write function
// documentation for all of your functions for this assignment.  You must
// use the function comment block format you have seen in previous
// assignments, including giving a name, short description, and
// documenting parameters and return value using @param and @returns
// tags respectively.
